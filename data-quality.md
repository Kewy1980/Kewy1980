## EPOS Multi-Scale Lab data
EPOS provides central access to Multi-Scale Lab (MSL) data, i.e. data from European, solid Earth scientific labs affiliated to EPOS MSL. The data are published and curated at data centers or data repositories across Europe. EPOS MSL harvests the metadata (e.g. title, authors, abstract, keywords, DOI) corresponding to the data publications from these European data centers. The metadata are then comprehensively presented  in the EPOS MSL data catalogue (epos-msl.uu.nl), and the EPOS central data portal (ICS-C). Metadata include links to the original data publication at the harboring data center.  

## Data quality
Although EPOS MSL and affiliated laboratories and data centers have exercised due care in seeking to ensure the accuracy of the information provided on this site, EPOS MSL, nor affiliated laboratories or data centers accept any liability for data flaws. All the content is presented ‘as is’ and ‘as available’. Any decisions you may take on the basis of this information are for your own expense and risk.

## Exclusion of liability
On no account will EPOS MSL, its individual participants, its managers or contributors be held liable for any direct or indirect, intangible or consequential loss or damage, including any loss of profits or income or any forfeited contracts, orders or proposals.
